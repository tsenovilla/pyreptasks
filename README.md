% pip install -r requirements.txt

This project uses "black" to format code. We support "pre-commit" to ensure this formatting has been run. If you have installed the requirements, you should have these packages already installed.

"Codecov" is set up for this project, so for any push or pull request you may check the code coverage report at https://app.codecov.io/gh/tsenovilla/pyreptasks.

Versions log
============

Version 1.0.0
-------------

- New module switch.py: Contains the class Switch, allowing the user to skip defining a switch structure.

Version 2.0.1
-------------

- Update of module switch.py: From this version, integer_switch is not a parameter anymore. This parameter was used in 
  a Switch object to indicate that the switch had to contain only integer keys. The parameter is deleted due to its
  functionality was not actually relevant. 

- Switch examples and tests updates to fit with the new version.

- Minor changes: Use of setuptools_scm (https://github.com/pypa/setuptools_scm/) package to manage version control instead of versioneer, used in the previous version. This also allows us to get rid of some configuration files in order to get a simpler package. 

NOTE: The use of version name 2.0.1 instead of 2.0.0 is due to setuptools_scm needs a non-zero last number.
