We are not going to deal with the exceptions, because this is not part of the DataFormatter class goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fields the user must send to the website will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Name and Last Name: The first letter of each word will be a capital letter. We accept only letters. We set a maximum length of 50 characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Phone Number: An integer, the length must be exactly 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Email: A mail address composed by alphanumeric characters. \".\",\"-\",\"_\" and \"@\" are also accepted here. \"@\" can appear just once in the email. We set a maximum length of 25 characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Country: The user's residence country, it will be stored in upper case. We set a maximum length of 20 characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Description: A short description of why the user is signing up into the website. The first letter will be capital and the rest will be lower case. We accept alphanumeric characters, also dots, commas, blank spaces and some other useful characters. As it is short, there is a maximum of 50 characters for this field.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Contribution: The user may contribute monthly with the website. To be part of it, the contribution must be at least of 3.99, but it cannot exceed 100. (This is just a number, the currency is not specified)\n",
    "\n",
    "REMARK: The user must fill all the data, so we set up the formatter to ensure that there is not any empty field. To do so, we use length and value ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "REMARK: There are many different possibilities to customize the fields, this example is just a quick overview."
